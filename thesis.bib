This has become particularly evident in the current data-intensive era of chemical research, with similarity measures serving as the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML) supervised and unsupervised procedures. Here, we present a discussion on the role of molecular similarity in drug design, chemical space exploration, chemical “art” generation, molecular representations, and many more. We also discuss more recent topics in molecular similarity, like the ability to efficiently compare large molecular libraries.},

  abstract = {Fingerprint similarity is a common method for comparing chemical structures. Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning (ML) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular ML methods: random forests and naïve Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.},

  abstract = {{Motivation: What if you could explain complex chemistry in a simple tree and share that data online with your collaborators? Computational biology often incorporates diverse chemical data to probe a biological question, but the existing tools for chemical data are ill-suited for the very large datasets inherent to bioinformatics. Furthermore, existing visualization methods often require an expert chemist to interpret the patterns. Biologists need an interactive tool for visualizing chemical information in an intuitive, accessible way that facilitates its integration into today’s team-based biological research.Results: ChemTreeMap is an interactive, bioinformatics tool designed to explore chemical space and mine the relationships between chemical structure, molecular properties, and biological activity. ChemTreeMap synergistically combines extended connectivity fingerprints and a neighbor-joining algorithm to produce a hierarchical tree with branch lengths proportional to molecular similarity. Compound properties are shown by leaf color, size and outline to yield a user-defined visualization of the tree. Two representative analyses are included to demonstrate ChemTreeMap’s capabilities and utility: assessing dataset overlap and mining structure–activity relationships.Availability and Implementation: The examples from this paper may be accessed at http://ajing.github.io/ChemTreeMap/.

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry data is one of the key sources of information in many workflows in medicine and across the life sciences. Mass fragmentation spectra are generally considered to be characteristic signatures of the chemical compound they originate from, yet the chemical structure itself usually cannot be easily deduced from the spectrum. Often, spectral similarity measures are used as a proxy for structural similarity but this approach is strongly limited by a generally poor correlation between both metrics. Here, we propose MS2DeepScore: a novel Siamese neural network to predict the structural similarity between two chemical structures solely based on their MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Using a cleaned dataset of > 100,000 mass spectra of about 15,000 unique known compounds, we trained MS2DeepScore to predict structural similarity scores for spectrum pairs with high accuracy. In addition, sampling different model varieties through Monte-Carlo Dropout is used to further improve the predictions and assess the model’s prediction uncertainty. On 3600 spectra of 500 unseen compounds, MS2DeepScore is able to identify highly-reliable structural matches and to predict Tanimoto scores for pairs of molecules based on their fragment spectra with a root mean squared error of about 0.15. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty estimate can be used to select a subset of predictions with a root mean squared error of about 0.1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MS2DeepScore outperforms classical spectral similarity measures in retrieving chemically related compound pairs from large mass spectral datasets, thereby illustrating its potential for spectral library matching. Finally, MS2DeepScore can also be used to create chemically meaningful mass spectral embeddings that could be used to cluster large numbers of spectra. Added to the recently introduced unsupervised Spec2Vec metric, we believe that machine learning-supported mass spectral similarity measures have great potential for a range of metabolomics data processing pipelines.},

  abstract  = {Covering: 2014 to 2023 for metabolomics, 2002 to 2023 for information visualizationLC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics is a rapidly developing research field spawning increasing numbers of computational metabolomics tools assisting researchers with their complex data processing, analysis, and interpretation tasks. In this article, we review the entire untargeted metabolomics workflow from the perspective of information visualization, visual analytics and visual data integration. Data visualization is a crucial step at every stage of the metabolomics workflow, where it provides core components of data inspection, evaluation, and sharing capabilities. However, due to the large number of available data analysis tools and corresponding visualization components, it is hard for both users and developers to get an overview of what is already available and which tools are suitable for their analysis. In addition, there is little cross-pollination between the fields of data visualization and metabolomics, leaving visual tools to be designed in a secondary and mostly ad hoc fashion. With this review, we aim to bridge the gap between the fields of untargeted metabolomics and data visualization. First, we introduce data visualization to the untargeted metabolomics field as a topic worthy of its own dedicated research, and provide a primer on cutting-edge visualization research into data visualization for both researchers as well as developers active in metabolomics. We extend this primer with a discussion of best practices for data visualization as they have emerged from data visualization studies. Second, we provide a practical roadmap to the visual tool landscape and its use within the untargeted metabolomics field. Here, for several computational analysis stages within the untargeted metabolomics workflow, we provide an overview of commonly used visual strategies with practical examples. In this context, we will also outline promising areas for further research and development. We end the review with a set of recommendations for developers and users on how to make the best use of visualizations for more effective and transparent communication of results.},
