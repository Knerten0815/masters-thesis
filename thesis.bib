  abstract = {Fingerprint similarity is a common method for comparing chemical structures. Similarity is an appealing approach because, with many fingerprint types, it provides intuitive results: a chemist looking at two molecules can understand why they have been determined to be similar. This transparency is partially lost with the fuzzier similarity methods that are often used for scaffold hopping and tends to vanish completely when molecular fingerprints are used as inputs to machine-learning (ML) models. Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model. We show the application of similarity maps to a set of dopamine D3 receptor ligands using atom-pair and circular fingerprints as well as two popular ML methods: random forests and naïve Bayes. An open-source implementation of the method is provided.},

This chapter deals with the subject of distances and similarities in data analysis. A data set is a finite set comprised of m sequences (x1 j . . . . . xn j), j ∈ { 1, . . . , m }, of length n. The values xi1, . . . , xim represent attribute Si. It can be numerical, including continuous (real numbers) and binary (presence/absence expressed by 1/0), ordinal (numbers expressing rank only), or nominal (which are not ordered). Cluster Analysis (or classification, taxonomy, and pattern recognition) consists mainly of partition of data A into relatively small number of clusters, that is, such sets of objects, that (with respect of selected measure of distance) the objects, at best possible degree, are “close” if they belong to the same cluster, “far” if they belong to different clusters, and further subdivision into clusters impair above two conditions. The chapter defines multidimensional scaling as a technique developed in the behavioral and social sciences for studying the structure of objects or people. Together with cluster analysis, it is based on distance methods. Similarities and distances for numerical data, relatives of Euclidean distance, and similarities and distances for binary data are described in the chapter.}

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry data is one of the key sources of information in many workflows in medicine and across the life sciences. Mass fragmentation spectra are generally considered to be characteristic signatures of the chemical compound they originate from, yet the chemical structure itself usually cannot be easily deduced from the spectrum. Often, spectral similarity measures are used as a proxy for structural similarity but this approach is strongly limited by a generally poor correlation between both metrics. Here, we propose MS2DeepScore: a novel Siamese neural network to predict the structural similarity between two chemical structures solely based on their MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Using a cleaned dataset of > 100,000 mass spectra of about 15,000 unique known compounds, we trained MS2DeepScore to predict structural similarity scores for spectrum pairs with high accuracy. In addition, sampling different model varieties through Monte-Carlo Dropout is used to further improve the predictions and assess the model’s prediction uncertainty. On 3600 spectra of 500 unseen compounds, MS2DeepScore is able to identify highly-reliable structural matches and to predict Tanimoto scores for pairs of molecules based on their fragment spectra with a root mean squared error of about 0.15. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty estimate can be used to select a subset of predictions with a root mean squared error of about 0.1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MS2DeepScore outperforms classical spectral similarity measures in retrieving chemically related compound pairs from large mass spectral datasets, thereby illustrating its potential for spectral library matching. Finally, MS2DeepScore can also be used to create chemically meaningful mass spectral embeddings that could be used to cluster large numbers of spectra. Added to the recently introduced unsupervised Spec2Vec metric, we believe that machine learning-supported mass spectral similarity measures have great potential for a range of metabolomics data processing pipelines.},

	abstract = {Quantifying molecular similarity is a cornerstone of cheminformatics, underpinning applications from virtual screening to chemical space visualization. A wide range of molecular fingerprints and similarity metrics, most notably Tanimoto scores, are employed, but their effectiveness is highly context-dependent. In this study, we systematically evaluate several 2D fingerprint types, including circular, path-based, and distance-encoded variants, using both binary and count representations. We highlight the consequences of fingerprint choice, vector folding, and similarity metric selection, revealing critical issues such as fingerprint duplication, mass-dependent score biases, and high bit collision rates. Sparse and count-based fingerprints consistently outperform fixed-size binary vectors in preserving structural distinctions. Furthermore, we introduce percentile-based normalization, propose inverse-document-frequency (IDF) weighting, and benchmark all methods against graph-based MCES similarities. Our results offer practical guidance for selecting molecular similarity measures, emphasizing the need for conscious, task-aware fingerprinting choices in large-scale chemical analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, https://ror.org/018mejw64, 528775510},

Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.},

In this article, we review the entire untargeted metabolomics workflow from the perspective of information visualization, visual analytics and visual data integration. Data visualization is a crucial step at every stage of the metabolomics workflow, where it provides core components of data inspection, evaluation, and sharing capabilities. However, due to the large number of available data analysis tools and corresponding visualization components, it is hard for both users and developers to get an overview of what is already available and which tools are suitable for their analysis. In addition, there is little cross-pollination between the fields of data visualization and metabolomics, leaving visual tools to be designed in a secondary and mostly ad hoc fashion. With this review, we aim to bridge the gap between the fields of untargeted metabolomics and data visualization. First, we introduce data visualization to the untargeted metabolomics field as a topic worthy of its own dedicated research, and provide a primer on cutting-edge visualization research into data visualization for both researchers as well as developers active in metabolomics. We extend this primer with a discussion of best practices for data visualization as they have emerged from data visualization studies. Second, we provide a practical roadmap to the visual tool landscape and its use within the untargeted metabolomics field. Here, for several computational analysis stages within the untargeted metabolomics workflow, we provide an overview of commonly used visual strategies with practical examples. In this context, we will also outline promising areas for further research and development. We end the review with a set of recommendations for developers and users on how to make the best use of visualizations for more effective and transparent communication of results.},

  abstract     = {Untargeted metabolomics experiments rely on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but these libraries are vastly incomplete; in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. As biological interpretation relies on accurate structure annotations, the ability to assign confidence to such annotations is a key outstanding problem. We introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines structure database generation, in silico annotation, and a confidence score consisting of kernel density p-value estimation and a Support Vector Machine with enforced directionality of features. In evaluation, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at small false discovery rates, and outperforms spectral library search for this purpose. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated twelve novel bile acid conjugates; nine structures were confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. Second, we annotated and manually evaluated 315 molecular structures in human samples currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Third, we applied COSMIC to 17,400 experimental runs and annotated 1,715 structures with high confidence that were absent from spectral libraries.Competing Interest StatementS.B., K.D., M.L., M.F., and M.A.H. are co-founders of Bright Giant GmbH.

Although improvements in mass detector sensitivity have facilitated the detection of greater numbers of analytes, compound identification strategies, feature reduction software, and data sharing have not kept up with the influx of MS data. Here, we discuss the ongoing challenges with MS-based metabolomics, including de novo metabolite identification from mass spectra, differentiation of metabolites from environmental contamination, chromatographic separation of isomers, and incomplete MS databases. Because of their popularity and sensitive detection of small molecules, this review focuses on the challenges of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based methods. We then highlight important instrumentational, experimental, and computational tools that have been created to address these challenges and how they have enabled the advancement of metabolomics research.},

  abstract       = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

  abstract = {The foundation of all biological processes is the network of diverse and dynamic protein interactions with other molecules in cells known as the interactome. Understanding the interactome is crucial for elucidating molecular mechanisms but has been a longstanding challenge. Recent developments in mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques, including affinity purification, proximity labeling, cross-linking, and co-fractionation mass spectrometry (MS), have significantly enhanced our abilities to study the interactome. They do so by identifying and quantifying protein interactions yielding profound insights into protein organizations and functions. This review summarizes recent advances in MS-based interactomics, focusing on the development of techniques that capture protein-protein, protein-metabolite, and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Additionally, we discuss how integrated MS-based approaches have been applied to diverse biological samples, focusing on significant discoveries that have leveraged our understanding of cellular functions. Finally, we highlight state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches for predictions of interactome and complex modeling, as well as strategies for combining experimental interactome data with computation methods, thereby enhancing the ability of MS-based techniques to identify protein interactomes. Indeed, advances in MS technologies and their integrations with computational biology provide new directions and avenues for interactome research, leveraging new insights into mechanisms that govern the molecular architecture of living cells and, thereby, our comprehension of biological processes.},

Spectral libraries used for identification are incomplete, and many metabolites remain unknown. There has been a recent development to replace spectral libraries by molecular structure databases when searching the MS/MS data of the unknown compound. Several tools have been developed for this task, including CFM-ID, MetFrag, MAGMa(+), FingerID and CSI:FingerID. These methods are already helpful for everyday metabolomics; with further advances, these methods can become indispensable tools for tomorrow's metabolomics. Here, I discuss several questions related to this task, such as: Why not wait for spectral libraries to grow sufficiently? Why evaluate methods outside their ‘comfort zone’? Should we use prior information such as citation frequencies? And, ultimately: are we there yet?},

  abstract     = {Small molecule machine learning tries to predict chemical, biochemical or biological properties from the structure of a molecule. Applications include prediction of toxicity, ligand binding or retention time. A recent trend is to develop end-to-end models that avoid the explicit integration of domain knowledge via inductive bias. A central assumption in doing so, is that there is no coverage bias in the training and evaluation data, meaning that these data are a representative subset of the true distribution we want to learn. Usually, the domain of applicability is neither considered nor analyzed for such large-scale end-to-end models.Here, we investigate how well certain large-scale datasets from the field cover the space of all known biomolecular structures. Investigation of coverage requires a sensible distance measure between molecular structures. We use a well-known distance measure based on solving the Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem, which agrees well with the chemical intuition of similarity between compounds. Unfortunately, this computational problem is provably hard, severely restricting the use of the corresponding distance measure in large-scale studies. We introduce an exact approach that combines Integer Linear Programming and intricate heuristic bounds to ensure efficient computations and dependable results.We find that several large-scale datasets frequently used in this domain of machine learning are far from a uniform coverage of known biomolecular structures. This severely confines the predictive power of models trained on this data. Next, we propose two further approaches to check if a training dataset differs substantially from the distribution of known biomolecular structures. On the positive side, our methods may allow creators of large-scale datasets to identify regions in molecular structure space where it is advisable to provide additional training data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Many such algorithms have been reported, and it is important to know which are likely to be the useful in operation. A detailed comparison was hence conducted of the efficiency (in terms of CPU time) and the effectiveness (in terms of the size of the MCS identified) of eleven MCS algorithms, some of which were exact and some of which were approximate in character. The algorithms were used to identify both connected and disconnected MCSs on a range of pairs of molecules. The fastest exact algorithms for the connected and disconnected problems were found to be the fMCS and MaxCliqueSeq algorithms, respectively, while the ChemAxon\_MCS algorithm was the fastest approximate algorithm for both types of problem.},
