First, a big shoutout to Prof. Dr. Florian Huber and Julian Pollmann, as well as the whole MatchMS team, for providing valuable guidance and introducing me to the fascinating world of cheminformatics.

To my family, for their support and encouragement _to finally get it done_ throughout my academic journey.

To Linda, Inge Brauch, Altbierstimmen DÃ¼sseldorf, and all of my friends who helped me take off my mind from time to time, and listened to my ramblings about what makes two molecules similar.

To Matze and Anja, for providing snacks and keeping the flat in shape, while I was lost to writing and coding.

And finally, I'd like to thank black tea for its existance and making this thesis possible.
