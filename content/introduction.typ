Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used analytical technique in chemistry and biology to identify and quantify molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The technique was first developed in the early 20th century @Thomson1910 @Dempster1918 and has evolved significantly over the years. Today, MS is used in various fields, including proteomics, metabolomics, and environmental analysis, to study the composition of substance samples and identify unknown compounds. One of the key challenges in MS is the interpretation of the acquired data, which often requires expert knowledge and sophisticated algorithms to derive meaningful information from the raw measurements. In recent years, machine learning and data visualization techniques have been increasingly applied to MS data analysis to automate and improve the interpretation process @Workman2024 @Yates2009 @Collins2021 @Wu2025 @Liebal2020. _*[Example ms2deepscore and its use in matchms and maybe Spec2Vec?]*_ The ChemSpaceExplorer project at University of Applied Sciences Düsseldorf aims to enhance the analysis of MS data by providing a visual representation of chemical space, allowing researchers to explore and compare mass spectra in a more intuitive way. The ChemSpaceExplorer returns a group of analogue spectra to a query spectrum based on their ms2deepscore @Huber2021 embeddings, which represent the spectra in a high-dimensional chemical space. The spectra are visualized in a 2D space using *????t-SNE?????*, where similar spectra are placed closer together. The molecular structure of the analogues is vizualized, which helps researchers in deriving the molecular structure of their query spectrum. This thesis aims to solve a specific problem the ChemSpaceExplorer project is facing, which is picking a reasonable amount of analogues to return and estimating how similiar a group of analogue compounds is to the query compound.

Molecular similarity represents a multidimensional concept that defies simple quantification. Depending on the analytical context, researchers may prioritize different structural features such as aromatic ring systems, aliphatic chain length, or specific functional groups. While reducing molecular similarity to scalar values facilitates database queries and machine learning applications, this dimensionality reduction inevitably sacrifices information richness. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when comparing multiple molecules to assess collective similarity within the group.

This challenge is evident in the ChemSpaceExplorer application, which constructs a chemical space using ms2deepscore embeddings. When querying a spectrum against this space, the system retrieves nearest neighbors based on embedding proximity. However, the chemical space exhibits heterogeneous density distribution - some regions contain tightly clustered compounds while others are sparsely populated. When a query falls within a dense cluster, its nearest neighbors typically exhibit high mutual similarity, enabling reliable inference of potential substructural elements present in the query compound. Conversely, if the query resides in a sparse region, retrieved neighbors may span significant distances in chemical space with minimal structural commonalities, necessitating lower confidence in the presented analogues.

Current approaches include calculating mean pairwise similarities within the analogue set, but this method both oversimplifies structural relationships and fails to account for proximity to the query embedding. The Integrated Similarity Flow (ISF) attempts to address these limitations by ranking analogues based on similarity sums weighted by query distance. However, this approach still reduces complex relationships to a single metric and employs conceptually abstract methodology that requires substantial domain knowledge to interpret effectively. What is needed is an intuitive visualization technique that explicitly illustrates similarity relationships among compounds and their spatial distribution relative to the query spectrum.

Improving the visualization and interpretation of molecular similarity in mass spectrometry represents a critical scientific need for several compelling reasons. First, enhancing interpretability of similarity models enables researchers to better understand the algorithmic basis of compound relationships, revealing potential biases or limitations in the underlying machine learning mechanisms. This interpretable framework provides essential context for evaluating confidence in structural predictions. Second, effective visualization of structural relationships among analogues offers crucial guidance for elucidating unknown compound structures—a fundamental challenge in analytical chemistry. When researchers can visually identify consistent structural patterns across multiple similar spectra, they gain valuable insights into potential substructural elements present in query compounds. Third, intuitive representation of chemical space density and similarity distributions significantly reduces cognitive load for analysts navigating complex datasets. By making relationship patterns immediately apparent rather than requiring extensive manual comparison of individual structures, researchers can focus their expertise on interpreting the biological or chemical significance of observed similarities. Collectively, these improvements would transform spectra analysis from a primarily expert-driven process to a more accessible, efficient, and reliable analytical methodology.

This thesis aims to enhance the interpretation of molecular similarity in mass spectrometry data analysis through improved visualization techniques. The primary objectives are:

+ *Develop an intuitive visual representation* of similarity relationships among a group of analogue compounds that effectively communicates both their mutual similarities and their proximity to the query spectrum.

// + *Design methods to quantify and visualize density variations* in chemical space, enabling analysts to assess confidence levels in returned analogues based on neighborhood characteristics.

// + *Create algorithms for adaptive selection of analogues* that account for local density variations in chemical space, ensuring that presented compounds offer meaningful structural insights regardless of the query spectrum's location.

+ *Evaluate the visualization approach* and compare it to other group similarity metrics.

+ *Integrate these visualizations into the ChemSpaceExplorer*, enhancing its capability to support structural elucidation of unknown compounds.

The research will focus on algorithmic development and visualization design, with evaluation based on computational validation against known molecular structures and objective performance metrics compared to existing approaches. Through these objectives, this thesis aims to transform the presentation of molecular similarity from abstract numerical values to rich, interpretable visual representations that leverage human pattern recognition capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor.
